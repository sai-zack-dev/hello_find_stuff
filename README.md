**Track #4: Building UI for the AI Era with Lynx**  
TikTok TechJam 2025 Submission – Solo Project by [Sai Zack](https://github.com/sai-zack-dev)

## 📖 Project Overview
**Hello Find Stuff (HFS)** is a new feature prototype for video-focused social media platforms.  
While users are watching reels, they often want to buy items shown in the video such as outfits, decorations, or accessories.  
With **HFS**, users can pause the video, scan it, and instantly search for similar items available in the shop.

This project is built as a **Lynx prototype** to demonstrate how AI-powered UI patterns can transform shopping experiences inside short-form video platforms.  
⚠️ Note: This is a **conceptual prototype** – no real AI or backend integration has been implemented.
